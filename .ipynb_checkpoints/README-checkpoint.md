# urban-sprawl-nairbo
This project uses machine learning and satellite imagery to map and analyze urban sprawl in Nairobi, Kenya. As one of East Africa's fastest-growing cities, Nairobi faces challenges from rapid and unregulated expansion, especially in informal settlements like Kibera and Korogocho.

In this project, we apply supervised classification models (Random Forest, SVM, kNN) to Landsat imagery and land use maps to:
- Detect and quantify urban growth
- Differentiate between formal and informal settlements
- Track spatial development trends over time

Our goal is to support data-driven planning efforts focused on public health, infrastructure, and environmental management.

**Data sources**: Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Nairobi Land Use Map
**Classes**: Informal settlements, formal settlements, vegetation
